  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/
     - assets/images/
     - assets/fonts/
     - assets/svg/
     - assets/svg/icons/
     - assets/svg/flags/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Mulish
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish/Mulish-Medium.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish/Mulish-Italic.ttf
           style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
